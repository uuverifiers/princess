# The Princess Theorem Prover

Princess is a theorem prover (aka SMT Solver) for Presburger
arithmetic with uninterpreted predicates, written entirely in <a
href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a>.  Princess can reason
about problems in integer arithmetic, augmented with predicates that
can be axiomatised arbitrarily. Such problems can contain arbitrary
quantifiers to express that some formula is supposed to hold for all
or for some integers. Princess also contains theory modules for, among
others, non-linear arithmetic, rationals, bit-vectors, arrays, heaps,
algebraic data-types, strings.
